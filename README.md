# Chat App Backend

Welcome to the Chat App Backend repository! This project serves as the backend implementation for a chat application written in Golang. In the future, we plan to integrate a frontend using React and Tailwind CSS to provide a seamless user experience.

## Features

- **Real-time Communication**: Utilizing WebSockets or another real-time communication protocol to enable instant messaging between users.
- **User Authentication**: Implementing user authentication and authorization to ensure secure access to chat features.
- **Message Persistence**: Storing chat messages in a database to maintain message history and enable offline access.
- **Scalability**: Designing the backend architecture to be scalable, allowing for handling a large number of concurrent users.
- **API Endpoints**: Providing RESTful API endpoints for managing users, conversations, and messages.

## Technologies Used

- **Golang**: Backend server implementation using the Go programming language.
- **WebSockets**: Real-time communication protocol for instant messaging.
- **Gin**: Web framework for building web applications in Go.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database management system for storing chat messages and user data.


## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tilekm/chat_app.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: 
    ```bash
    cd chat_app/server
    # Install Golang dependencies
    go mod download
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Server**: 
    ```bash
    go run cmd/main.go
    ```

2. **Access the API**: 
    - The server will be running at `http://localhost:8000`.
    - Use tools like Postman or cURL to interact with the API endpoints.

## Future Enhancements

- **Integrate Frontend**: Develop a frontend using React and Tailwind CSS to provide a user-friendly interface for the chat application.
- **Enhanced Security**: Implement additional security measures such as encryption for message transmission and authentication.
- **User Profile Management**: Add functionality for users to manage their profiles, update settings, and view their activity.
